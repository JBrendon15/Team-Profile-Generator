# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
For this project, we used inquirer to present a user with a set of questions about that team that they want to build. The values of the user inputs are captured and used to later create an HTML page. We used jest to run tests on our functions to make sure they are returning the info that we need. We then use template literal to generate an HTML in the dist folder with cards for all the members created. For this project we learned to create seperate files for specific functions to keep the code cleaner. We learned how to properly export from one file and import it so that we can access a function in a different file.
